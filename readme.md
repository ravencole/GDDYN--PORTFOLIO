GDDYNYTDTLLS.COM
----------------
is a portfolio site made by Raven Cole.

Welcome to the source code.

The humble beginnings of gddynytdtlls start with me learning to write html
and PHP in VIM on a RaspberryPi, because my 8 year old mac book pro finally
died and I needed to display a web page on a sculpture I was making. 
Shouts outs to w3m. Its been a long time since i dropped 400 lines of PHP into the
center of an HTML document, but the memory is warm and present.

The front-end for the site is *mostly* React, and the backend is Laravel.
The React styling library Radium is also being used, and some Jquery
has been sprinkled in for the damn of it (or to make AJAX calls/handle keydowns
site wide, because the thing as a whole isn't using React, but the Terminal is and it's
on every page). 

The back-end is Laravel with future growth in mind (or maybe because I like PHP). 
Otherwise it would probably be a MEAN stack or something like it. 
A MYSQL database is doing a small amount of work for the maps page.

Right now the Terminal is being rewritten. I've know it was a mess since the 
beginning, but I'm glad I made a whole working prototype before going a head
with the rewrite. The new Terminal is going to rely on an MVC pattern, which it does
now too, just in a gross messy way,  and be released as a React library. After that
I'll likely release a vanilla JS version with no dependencies. 

Right now the site is, presentation-wise, where it needs to be for now, but the 
code is still being refactored.
